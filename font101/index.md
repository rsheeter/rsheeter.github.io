## Basic Work Environment

I assume you have:

*  SSH access to github ([instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh))
*  A Python virtual environment ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
```shell
# create lots, typically one for every discrete thing you are working on
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
*  If on Mac, install coreutils so `realpath` is present. Homebrew: `brew install coreutils`.

## FontTools

FontTools is the swiss army knife of fonts. It lets you load, modify, and save a font from Python.

I assume you want to be able to mess with the source, and that you have an active venv. If you don't need to play with the code just `pip install fonttools`. If you just want to browse the source see https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools

### Local Setup
```shell
git clone git@github.com:fonttools/fonttools.git
pip install -e fonttools/
```

### TTX

TTX is an xml representation of a binary font. FontTools can transform to/from TTX, meaning you can make changes to a font binary by converting it to TTX, editing the XML, and converting it back again. 

The examples assume a clone of `https://github.com/google/fonts` exists in `./fonts`.

Let's try it out with a Google Font:

```shell
ttx fonts/ofl/lato/Lato-Regular.ttf
# open and browse around fonts/ofl/lato/Lato-Regular.ttx
# If we made some changes and wanted to generate an updated font binary:
ttx -o /tmp/MyLato.ttf fonts/ofl/lato/Lato-Regular.ttx
```

Sometimes we just want to glance at a single table. For example, let's dump the ['name'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/name) table for Lato:

```shell
ttx -o - -t name fonts/ofl/lato/Lato-Regular.ttf
```

To see what axes and named instances a variable font supports we could dump ['fvar'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/fvar):

```shell
ttx -o - -t fvar fonts/ofl/mavenpro/MavenPro\[wght\].ttf
```

See also FontTools explanation of TTX [here](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools#ttx--from-opentype-and-truetype-to-xml-and-back).

### TTFont

[TTFont](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/blob/master/Lib/fontTools/ttLib/ttFont.py) is a Python class that can 
read/write OpenType font files. For example, let's suppose we decided `Lato-Regular.ttf` had the wrong metadata for weight and we want to fix [usWeightClass](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#usweightclass) programmatically:

```shell
# clone https://github.com/google/fonts, assumed to be in ./fonts for this example
python
>>> from fontTools import ttLib
>>> font = ttLib.TTFont('fonts/ofl/lato/Lato-Regular.ttf')
>>> font['OS/2'].usWeightClass
400
>>> font['OS/2'].usWeightClass = 500
>>> font.save('/tmp/Lato-Modified.ttf')
# Ctrl+D to exit python repl
```

We could confirm our edit with TTX:

```shell
ttx -q -o - -t "OS/2" /tmp/Lato-Modified.ttf | grep usWeight
    <usWeightClass value="500"/>
```

### pyftsubset

[pyftsubset](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/blob/master/Lib/fontTools/subset/__init__.py) lets you cut up fonts.

If you look at the CSS Google Fonts send to consumers (ex [Roboto](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto)) you can see a bunch of different `@font-face` blocks, each with it's own unicode-range. The browser will download only the parts required to render the characters on the page (more detail on this [here](https://www.unicodeconference.org/presentations-42/S5T3-Sheeter.pdf)).

Let's suppose we want to cut a cyrillic block out of Roboto, matching the unicode-range for cyrillic from `/css2`:

```css
/* cyrillic */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Roboto'), local('Roboto-Regular'), url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/roboto/v20/KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu5mxKOzY.woff2) format('woff2');
  unicode-range: U+0400-045F, U+0490-0491, U+04B0-04B1, U+2116;
}
```

We'll start from `fonts/ofl/roboto/static/Roboto-Regular.ttf`, which supports many scripts, and cut out everything but cyrillic:

```shell
pyftsubset --help
pyftsubset fonts/ofl/roboto/static/Roboto-Regular.ttf \
  --unicodes="U+0400-045F, U+0490-0491, U+04B0-04B1, U+2116" \
  --output-file=/tmp/Roboto-Regular-Cyrillic.ttf
```

The subsetter can also be used as a library:

```shell
python
>>> from fontTools import subset, ttLib
>>> font = ttLib.TTFont('fonts/ofl/roboto/static/Roboto-Regular.ttf')

>>> subset_opts = subset.Options()
>>> subsetter = subset.Subsetter(options=subset_opts)
>>> subsetter.populate(text='ABC')
>>> subsetter.subset(font)
>>> font.save('/tmp/Roboto-ABC.ttf')
```

You can also use the fontTools subsetter to drop hints, remove unwanted layout features, etc.

The original file is, at time of writing, 168KB. The cyrillic subset is 24KB. By default `pyftsubset` performs a number of optimizations that remove parts of the font unlikely to be needed for web usage. If you want to remove characters and keep everything else you have to opt out of this. See `--help`.

## OpenType Fonts

The font format of most interest to Google Fonts, supported by most modern operating systems, browsers, etc is [OpenType](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/). The font is made up of a header plus a collection of "tables". Each table has a specific binary structure documented in the spec. A given font includes some subset of these tables.

### Glyph IDs and the 'cmap' table

To understand the OpenType format it's helpful to have a basic mental model of how it works. Here is mine:

*  The core construct is an array of glyphs
   *  This is not how it's represented internally but it can be thought of this way
*  A glyph is instructions on how to draw something.
   *  It is NOT a character / letter
*  The indices of glyphs are called "glyph ids" or "gids"
   * We'll use "gid" henceforth
   
Let's construct a simple example. We'll subset Roboto down to A,B,C plus some support glyphs, then look at it's gids and how unicode characters are mapped onto those gids.
```
For example, 

glyphs [ notdef ][ null ][ drawing of letter A ][ drawing of letter B ][ drawing of letter C ]
gid     0         1        2                      3                      4
```
If we want to render "A" (U+0041 in Unicode) using this font we have a problem: how do we know what gid to use?
This is handled by the ['cmap'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap) table, which maps character
codes (Unicode or otherwise) to gids. Let's look at an example by subsetting Roboto down to ABC using [pyftsubset](#pyftsubset):

```shell
pyftsubset fonts/ofl/roboto/static/Roboto-Regular.ttf \
  --text="ABC" \
  --output-file=/tmp/Roboto-Regular-ABC.ttf
```

FontTools tries to give you the glyphs by name as well as gid. For example, using our subset Roboto:

```shell
python
>>> from fontTools import ttLib
>>> font = ttLib.TTFont('/tmp/Roboto-Regular-ABC.ttf')
>>> font.getGlyphOrder()
['.notdef', 'A', 'B', 'C']
>>> [font.getGlyphID(name) for name in font.getGlyphOrder()]
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```

We can also see the this in the TTX output:

```shell
ttx -q -t cmap -o - /tmp/Roboto-Regular-ABC.ttf
```

You should see something like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ttFont sfntVersion="\x00\x01\x00\x00" ttLibVersion="4.2">

  <cmap>
    <tableVersion version="0"/>
    <cmap_format_4 platformID="0" platEncID="3" language="0">
      <map code="0x41" name="A"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A -->
      <map code="0x42" name="B"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B -->
      <map code="0x43" name="C"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C -->
    </cmap_format_4>
    <cmap_format_4 platformID="3" platEncID="1" language="0">
      <map code="0x41" name="A"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A -->
      <map code="0x42" name="B"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B -->
      <map code="0x43" name="C"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C -->
    </cmap_format_4>
    <cmap_format_12 platformID="3" platEncID="10" format="12" reserved="0" length="28" language="0" nGroups="1">
      <map code="0x41" name="A"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A -->
      <map code="0x42" name="B"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B -->
      <map code="0x43" name="C"/><!-- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C -->
    </cmap_format_12>
  </cmap>

</ttFont>
```

## Building Fonts with Fontmake

[Fontmake](https://github.com/googlefonts/) is a command-line tool that compiles font
sources to binary OpenType fonts. It supports sources in either
[Glyphs.app](https://glyphsapp.com) format or [UFO](https://unifiedfontobject.org) format
(which is the native format used by [Robofont](https://robofont.com) app and can be
imported/exported in most font editors).

Fontmake is just the compiler frontend, so to speak. Most of the heavy lifting work is
done under the hood by a collections of Python libraries, including:

- [glyphsLib](https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsLib): to parse Glyphs files and
  convert them to UFO format.
- [ufo2ft](https://github.com/googlefonts/ufo2ft): takes UFO font objects and uses
  FontTools to build the various OpenType tables.
- [cu2qu](https://github.com/googlefonts/cu2qu): converts cubic Bezier curves (as
  used by most font editing apps for drawing) to the kind of quadratic splines used
  in TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts.

You can install the `fontmake` CLI tool as usual with `pip install fontmake`.
Or you can also download a self-contained zip-app from the fontmake [releases](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontmake/releases)
page. Pick the one matching your local python3 version and platform, unzip it and run
it like a regular executable.

For example, say you want build a variable font for the Oswald project:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/googlefonts/OswaldFont
$ cd OswaldFont
$ fontmake -g sources/Oswald.glyphs -o variable
```

You'll find your Oswald-VF.ttf inside `./variable_ttf` subfolder.

If you want to build static instances, you use `-i` option:

```
$ fontmake -g sources/Oswald.glyphs -i
```

By default fontmake will build _both_ TTF and OTF static fonts (respectively in
``instance_ttf`` and ``instance_otf`` folders).

Read ``fontmake --help`` for more options.

## Drawing Text

Once our font is looking good we might want to render text with it. A full text rendering stack is typically a collection of components. We'll look primarily at the open options:

1.  Shaping: given a sequence of character codes, figure out what gids should be drawn at what positions
    *  The leading open tool for shaping is HarfBuzz ([code](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz), [documentation](https://harfbuzz.github.io))
    *  HarfBuzz [definition](https://harfbuzz.github.io/what-is-harfbuzz.html#what-is-text-shaping) of shaping
    *  If this is your first encounter with shaping beware, it's WAY more complicated than it might sound
    *  [What HarfBuzz doesn't do](https://harfbuzz.github.io/what-harfbuzz-doesnt-do.html)
1.  Justification
    *  Splitting text into lines of similar length, avoiding excessive whitespace
    *  [Minikin](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/minikin/) works with HarfBuzz to do this on Android
    *  Text Justification [lecture](https://youtu.be/ENyox7kNKeY?t=1025)
1.  Rendering
    *  Actually putting pixels onto the screen.
    *  [Skia](https://skia.org/) is a leading open 2d graphics library.

    
See also [A Tour of Android Typography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8LD0BM-Vjk).

### Building HarfBuzz

See https://harfbuzz.github.io/building.html

### hb-shape

Let's shape some text using the HarfBuzz
[hb-shape](https://harfbuzz.github.io/utilities.html#utilities-command-line-hbshape) tool. The examples assume harfbuzz is cloned and compiled at `./harfbuzz` and a clone of `https://github.com/google/fonts` exists at `./fonts`.

```shell
harfbuzz/util/hb-shape --help
harfbuzz/util/hb-shape fonts/ofl/roboto/static/Roboto-Regular.ttf "ABC"
[gid37=0+1336|gid38=1+1275|gid39=2+1333]

# ...What?
harfbuzz/util/hb-shape --help-output-syntax

# OK, I just want gid and advance
harfbuzz/util/hb-shape fonts/ofl/roboto/static/Roboto-Regular.ttf "ABC" \
                       --no-glyph-names --no-clusters
[37+1336|38+1275|39+1333]
```

Hopefully this illustrates that hb-shape runs on a single run of characters in a single font and tells you what gids to use and how to lay them out. You still need something else to actually DO that, but HarfBuzz has done a LOT of the hard work for you.

### hb-view

[hb-view](https://harfbuzz.github.io/utilities.html#utilities-command-line-hbview) lets you shape and render a string. For example:

```shell
harfbuzz/util/hb-view fonts/ofl/roboto/static/Roboto-Regular.ttf "ABC" \
                      --output-file=/tmp/roboto-abc.png
# Open /tmp/roboto-abc.png in your viewer of choice
```

## Web Serving

Sometimes after you create a font you want to use it on the internet. There are several tools and technologies you are likely to encounter:

1.  OpenType Sanitizer ([OTS](https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots))
    *   Chrome and Firefox reject fonts that don't pass OTS checks
    *   The simplest way to test is to load your font in a browser and if it doesn't work check devtools for a console message about failing OTS
    *   You can also build OTS from source and use the ot-sanitise utility; we'll show an example later
1.  [WOFF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format)
    *   The best available font compression format, available in all modern browsers (https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff2)
1.  [unicode-range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range)
    *   Allows us to cut up a font (perhaps using [pyftsubset](#pyftsubset) or [hb-subset](#hb-subset)), tell the browser about the pieces and what characters they contain, and have it download only the ones it actually uses.
    *   Our IUC42 presentation on CJK ([here](https://www.unicodeconference.org/presentations-42/S5T3-Sheeter.pdf)) talks more about unicode-range and how it can be used to serve large fonts

### DIY Google Fonts

Let's use some of the tools we've seen and build our very own copy of Google Fonts! - note that we're going to use python [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) which is NOT suitable for production according to it's documentation.

#### Basic Server

```shell
# Google Fonts fonts
git clone git@github.com:google/fonts.git

# Grab all the fonts and put them into /byogf/fonts
mkdir -p byogf/fonts
find fonts -path 'fonts/*/*/*.[ot]tf' -execdir cp {} $(realpath byogf/fonts/) \;
ls -l byogf/fonts | wc -l # should be ~3,000
```

Now we have `byogf/fonts` setup let's make ourselves a server. Create a file in byogf called `font_server.py` with the following content:

{% raw %}
```python
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
import textwrap
import urllib

_CSS_FOR_STYLE = {
    'Thin': 'font-weight: 100;',
    'ExtraLight': 'font-weight: 200;',
    'Light': 'font-weight: 300;',
    'Regular': '',
    'Medium': 'font-weight: 500;',
    'SemiBold': 'font-weight: 600;',
    'Bold': 'font-weight: 700;',
    'ExtraBold': 'font-weight: 800;',
    'Black': 'font-weight: 900;',
}
_CSS_FOR_STYLE.update({k + 'Italic': v + ' font-style: italic;'
                       for k, v in _CSS_FOR_STYLE.items()})
_CSS_FOR_STYLE['Italic'] = _CSS_FOR_STYLE.pop('RegularItalic')

class FontHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def _serve_css(self):
        family, style = self.path[1:].split('/')
        style_css = _CSS_FOR_STYLE[style]
        css = f'''
        @font-face {{
            font-family: '{family}';
            {style_css}
            src: url(/fonts/{family}-{style}.ttf) format('truetype');
        }}
        '''
        css = textwrap.dedent(css)

        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-Type', 'text/css; charset=utf-8')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(css.encode('utf-8'))

    def do_GET(self):
        if self.path == '/favicon.ico':
            self.send_response(404)
            self.end_headers()
        elif self.path.startswith('/fonts/'):
            super().do_GET()
        elif self.path.endswith('.html'):
            super().do_GET()
        else:
            # Blindly assume CSS request!
            self._serve_css()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Starting server, use <Ctrl-C> to stop')
    HTTPServer(('', 8080), FontHandler).serve_forever()
```
{% endraw %}

Start it similar to `python3 font_server.py`. Try urls like http://localhost:8080/Lobster/Regular or http://localhost:8080/Lato/ThinItalic in your browser. Try creating a file `byogf/demo.html` with content similar to:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    @import url(http://localhost:8080/Lobster/Regular);
    @import url(http://localhost:8080/Lato/ThinItalic);
    .lobster {
      font-family: 'Lobster';
    }
    .lato100i {
      font-family: 'Lato';
      font-style: italic;
      font-weight: 100;
    }
    body {
      font-size: 4em;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="lobster">Hello, World</div>
  <div class="lato100i">Hello, World</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Load by requesting http://localhost:8080/demo.html in your browser. You should see text in Lobster and Lato, similar to:

![Text Demo](./lobster_lato.png)

If you look in browser dev tools (in Chrome: right-click, inspect, choose the Network tab) you should see the font downloads in ttf format.

Congratulations, you have implemented your own version of Google Fonts!

#### Compression

Serving the raw font files is fine, but we can do better. We'll replicate Google Fonts transparent upgrade to woff2. Just like Google Fonts (woff2 [blog post](https://developers.googleblog.com/2015/02/smaller-fonts-with-woff-20-and-unicode.html)), our users won't have to change anything about their integration: font downloads get smaller for all users as soon as the server updates.

```shell
# Create compressed copies using woff2
# woff2 has submodules, use --recursive to grab them too
git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/woff2.git
(cd woff2 && make clean all)

# warning: SLOW; we "pay" now to make our users downloads faster
# If you are just playing maybe do a subset of the files, perhaps -name 'Noto*.[ot]tf'
time find byogf/fonts -name '*.[ot]tf' -execdir ./woff2/woff2_compress {} \;
```

Now we have a woff2 file for every font, add it to the CSS. Open `font_server.py` and amend the CSS construction:

{% raw %}```python
BEFORE
        css = f'''
        @font-face {{
            font-family: '{family}';
            {style_css}
            src: url(/fonts/{family}-{style}.ttf) format('truetype');
        }}
        '''
AFTER
        css = f'''
        @font-face {{
            font-family: '{family}';
            {style_css}
            src: url(/fonts/{family}-{style}.woff2) format('woff2'),
                 url(/fonts/{family}-{style}.ttf) format('truetype');
        }}
        '''
```{% endraw %}

Restart the server and retry your demo.html. You should see in dev tools that you are now downloading woff2 files instead of ttfs.

#### unicode-range

[unicode-range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range) lets us cut a font into pieces, tell the browser what codepoints are available in each piece, and have the browser download only the pieces it needs. The CSS looks like this:

```css
/* Simplification of http://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Merriweather */

/* cyrillic */
@font-face
    font-family: 'Merriweather';
    src: url(.../merriweather/cyrillic.woff2); /* Download this */
    unicode-range: U+0400-045F;                /* If page uses these codepoints */

/* latin */
@font-face
    font-family: 'Merriweather';
    src: url(.../merriweather/latin.woff2);    /* Download this */
    unicode-range: U+0000-00FF;                /* If page uses these codepoints */
```

Google Fonts publishes files listing how we cut up fonts [here](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings).

For Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) we cut each font into a larger number (~100) of pieces (explained in our IUC42 [presentation](https://www.unicodeconference.org/presentations-42/S5T3-Sheeter.pdf)). The CJK subsetting files are not published at time of writing.
